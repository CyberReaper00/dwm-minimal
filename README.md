# Charge Color Patch
The Charge Color patch is built to dynamically switch between predefined color schemes depending on whether the system is running on AC power or battery. When you plug in or unplug the charger, DWM automatically updates the bar, borders and focused window colors to reflect the current power state

The default colorscheme is a blue theme and a red theme is set for when the charger is unplugged, the colors can be change in the `config.def.h`
